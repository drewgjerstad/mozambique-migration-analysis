## Introduction
In this project, we focus on the prediction (more generally, the estimation) of
individuals who have recently migrated in Mozambique based on data collected by
the _Instituto Nacional de Estatística_ (INE) in 1997, 2007, and 2017 which was
made available by IPUMS International (referred to herein as the Mozambique
dataset). Census microdata, such as this dataset, is unique since it is made up
of features collected at the individual level, rather than aggregated statistics
that are typical in other census datasets. Furthermore, the 2017 sample in this
dataset was only recently released meaning that the relationships are relatively
unexplored.

We are primarily focusing on the exploration of methods used to extract insights
and inferences from a large, high-dimensional, and temporal dataset. The
Mozambique dataset should be great for this as it spans three decades and has
numerous potential features we can use in our analyses. Furthermore, we are also
aiming to develop a principled data preprocessing pipeline for the dataset as
there are several considerations that must be made.
